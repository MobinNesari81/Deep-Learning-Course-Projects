**Student:** Mobin Nesari  
**Professor:** Dr. Saeed Reza Kheradpisheh  
**Course:** Deep Learning

This repository contains various deep learning projects completed for the **Deep Learning Course** during the Fall Semester of 2022. Each project explores different neural network architectures and techniques, focusing on image classification tasks and model evaluations.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Course Overview

These projects demonstrate the foundational and advanced concepts of deep learning covered in the course, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and autoencoders. We utilize popular datasets like CIFAR-10 and Intel Image Classification, applying models like VGG, ResNeXt, and custom Autoencoders. 

## üìÇ Project Structure

Each folder contains a project notebook focused on a specific deep learning architecture or technique:

- **CIFAR-10 Classification with VGG16 and VGG18**  
  Implementation of the VGG16 and VGG18 architectures for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, including model training, evaluation, and confusion matrix analysis.

- **ResNeXt Model for Image Classification**  
  A ResNeXt model used for classifying images in the Intel Image Classification dataset, utilizing grouped convolutions for an efficient and accurate model structure.

- **Autoencoder for CIFAR-10**  
  An autoencoder model designed to compress and reconstruct CIFAR-10 images, demonstrating unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction.

Each notebook includes detailed documentation, with code comments, explanations, and visualizations to facilitate understanding of each project‚Äôs process and objectives.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run these projects on your local machine, clone the repository and set up the environment with the necessary packages.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Deep_Learning_Projects.git
cd Deep_Learning_Projects
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python and `pip` installed. Then, install the required packages:

```

### 3. Run the Notebooks

You can run each project notebook individually using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

```bash
jupyter notebook Project_Name.ipynb
```

## üìù Project Notebooks

- **CIFAR-10 VGG Classification**: Demonstrates image classification using VGG16 and VGG18 on CIFAR-10.
- **ResNeXt Image Classification**: Implementation of ResNeXt for the Intel Image Classification dataset.
- **CIFAR-10 Autoencoder**: Unsupervised learning with an autoencoder for CIFAR-10 image compression and reconstruction.

## üìà Future Improvements

To further enhance these projects, consider:
- Experimenting with additional data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- Testing different learning rates, batch sizes, or optimizers to refine model performance.
- Incorporating transfer learning or pre-trained models for faster convergence on certain tasks.
