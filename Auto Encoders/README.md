# üß© CIFAR-10 Autoencoder Project

This project demonstrates an **Autoencoder** model for the **CIFAR-10** dataset, 
where we aim to compress and reconstruct images using an unsupervised learning approach. 
An Autoencoder is a powerful model that learns an efficient, compact representation of input data,
making it a useful tool for feature extraction, denoising, and dimensionality reduction.

## üìö Project Overview

In this notebook, we will:
1. **Load and Preprocess** the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. **Build an Autoencoder Model** with encoder and decoder structures.
3. **Train the Autoencoder** to reconstruct images by minimizing reconstruction loss.
4. **Evaluate Reconstruction Quality** by visualizing reconstructed images.

Autoencoders are particularly useful for applications that benefit from compact data representations.
Let's dive into unsupervised learning! üöÄ

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

To run this notebook, ensure your environment has the necessary libraries. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CIFAR10_Autoencoder.git
   cd CIFAR10_Autoencoder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** - this notebook requires PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook** - Open the notebook file using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cifar10_autoencoder.ipynb
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

Each cell in the notebook is documented with clear explanations and code comments. 
You can run the cells in order for a step-by-step experience in building and training the Autoencoder model.

### Key Sections and Code Examples:

1. **Import Libraries and Set Seed**: We begin by importing essential libraries and setting a random seed for reproducibility.

   ```python
   import torch
   import torch.nn as nn
   import numpy as np
   import random
   SEED = 87
   torch.manual_seed(SEED)
   ```

2. **Data Loading & Normalization**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and normalized for training.

   ```python
   transform = transforms.Compose([
       transforms.ToTensor(),
       transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
   ])
   trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
   ```

3. **Autoencoder Architecture**: Our model consists of an encoder that compresses the image and a decoder that reconstructs it.

   ```python
   class Autoencoder(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self):
           super(Autoencoder, self).__init__()
           # Encoder layers...
           # Decoder layers...
   ```

4. **Training Loop**: The model is trained using MSE loss to minimize the reconstruction error.

   ```python
   loss = criterion(output, data)  # Calculate reconstruction loss
   loss.backward()  # Backpropagate
   optimizer.step()  # Update weights
   ```

5. **Visualizing Results**: After training, we visualize original vs. reconstructed images to assess model performance.

## ü§î Potential Improvements

- Experiment with different network architectures for improved compression and reconstruction quality.
- Try denoising techniques by adding noise to the input images and training the model to denoise them.
- Explore feature extraction by using the encoder's output as features for supervised tasks like classification.
