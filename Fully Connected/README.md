# üëó Fashion MNIST Classifier - Deep Learning Project

Welcome to the **Fashion MNIST Classifier**! This project demonstrates how to build and train a deep learning model to classify images in the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of clothing items like shirts, trousers, dresses, and shoes. This notebook is an educational resource and practical example for building image classifiers using PyTorch. 

## üìö Project Overview

In this notebook, we will:
1. **Load and Explore** the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2. **Preprocess** the data for optimal performance in training.
3. **Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify the images.
4. **Train and Evaluate** the model to achieve a high accuracy in classifying clothing types.
5. **Visualize Results** to understand model performance.

Let's dive in! üöÄ

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

To get started, you'll need to set up your environment with the necessary packages. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Fashion_MNIST_Classifier.git
   cd Fashion_MNIST_Classifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** - the notebook uses PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook** - Open Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and start the `Fashion_MNIST_Solution.ipynb` file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Fashion_MNIST_Solution.ipynb
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

This notebook is designed to be modular and interactive! Follow the cells in order for a smooth experience. Each section is documented to guide you through the process, from loading data to evaluating the model.

### Key Sections and Code Examples:

1. **Importing Libraries**: We use PyTorch for the model, NumPy for handling arrays, and Matplotlib for visualizations.

   ```python
   import torch
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from torchvision import datasets, transforms
   from torch import nn, optim
   ```

2. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: We download the Fashion MNIST dataset and apply normalization for faster training.
   
   ```python
   transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(),
                                   transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))])
   trainset = datasets.FashionMNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
   ```

3. **Model Architecture**: We use a simple CNN with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

   ```python
   class FashionCNN(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self):
           super(FashionCNN, self).__init__()
           # Define layers here...
   ```

4. **Training the Model**: The training loop includes forward passes, calculating losses, and backpropagation to update weights.

   ```python
   optimizer.zero_grad()
   loss.backward()
   optimizer.step()
   ```

5. **Evaluating Model Performance**: After training, we evaluate the model on test data and visualize results.

## üìà Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately **85%** on the test set, demonstrating effective classification for this dataset. Feel free to experiment with the model architecture, learning rate, or other hyperparameters to see if you can improve accuracy!

## ü§î Possible Improvements

Consider enhancing the model with additional layers, dropout, or data augmentation for potentially better performance. Also, tuning hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size might yield improved results.
